Show saved chemicals update
big chemical to show it can handle it - silicon + 4x hydrogen, boron + 3x fluorine, water, carbon + 4x hydrogen, lithium + 2x oxygen <--- some interesting molecules that we could demonstrate
Demonstrate all features (Clear combine, back to menu ect)

How it fits the brief


The Department of Specific Sciency Matters (DSSM) science education division wants to 
turn every child in the country into a scientist, and the software we have developed helps
them in this goal. We have created "Chemical Creator", an interactive and educational chemistry
set for the use in schools. Chemical Creator allows children to play with elements that they
would not have access to, or would be too dangers to handle.

{Go to help page}

Here you see the information page for the software, explaning how to use it and what it does.
Chemical Creator allows you to drag and drop elements to create new ones, as we will now demonstrate


---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

{Back To menu -> Start (Game screen)}

Create silicon + 4x Hydrogen (Seline)
Show Right Click info

Put Magnesesium + berrilum, shows not a compound, and shows clear

litium + 2x oxygen (Litium Oxide)

{Quit to menu -> my compounds}
Show, back to start and create 
boron + 3x fluorine (Boron Tri-fluoride)

{back to my compounds to show it has updated}
(Mention that it saves the compounds made to a file so it works after starting and stopping)


This software is designed to help in school chemisty classrooms, and would be a useful tool 
for educating children about molecules
