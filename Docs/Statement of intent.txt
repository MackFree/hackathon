SOI:
We intend to make a educational peice of software for children in the chemistry classroom. The point of this software
is to allow kids to play with elements and molecules to learn via experimentation what everyday substances are made of,
and also stay safe while doing it. Our software will have a menu of elements to be dragged and dropped into an area, and 
when the student has added the wanted elements, can press play and see if they form into a molecule. For example, if the 
student adds two hydrogen atoms and one oxygen atom, and presses play, it will form water. Colour scheme would be simple,
vibrant and the software will be in the form of a two dimentional "game". This sofware will help the Science Education 
department under the DSSM to help educate students.
